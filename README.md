## Research and Inspiration

Dino Journey is grounded in research on mental health benefits from pets and gamification. Our app addresses issues of guilt-based productivity and impersonal support in existing tools by providing a companion that grows with the user in a non-judgmental way. We used a research-backed approach to develop features like:

- The positive impact of virtual companions on mental health.
- Avoiding guilt-based reinforcement methods.
- Using gamification to improve app retention and user engagement.
